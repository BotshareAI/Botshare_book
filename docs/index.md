## Problem-based learning

Small and medium-sized warehouses face increasing pressure to handle growing e-commerce demand, optimize storage, and reduce operational costs. Traditional automation solutions are expensive and complex, leaving many SMEs without scalable options. Many businesses struggle with labor shortages, inefficient inventory management, and high order fulfillment costs.  

The lack of accessible automation training further limits the ability of businesses to implement effective solutions. Many engineers, operators, and business owners lack the **knowledge, skills, and tools** needed to adopt robotics, AI, and deep-tech innovations.

## Our solution

**Open Robotics AI & Deep-Tech Education** is an **open-source educational initiative** that not only provides structured training but also enables hands-on engagement with real automation systems. Our platform is built around two key open-source projects:  

- **OpenAMR** â€“ Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) for warehouse logistics, material handling, and automation.  
- **EasyMove** â€“ AI-powered, **puzzle-based automated rack-moving system** for intelligent storage, sorting, and replenishment.  

By combining AMRs with **AI-driven dynamic storage**, we provide an **affordable, scalable, and flexible warehouse automation solution** for businesses while **training professionals in deep-tech disciplines**.

## Who benefits from this initiative?

- **E-commerce fulfillment centers** â€“ Automating order picking and last-mile logistics.  
- **E-grocery fulfillment warehouses** â€“ Optimizing fresh food storage and dispatch.  
- **CEP (Courier, Express, and Parcel) sorting hubs** â€“ Enhancing parcel routing and last-mile delivery.  
- **SMEs and startups** â€“ Learning how to implement AI-driven warehouse automation at a lower cost.  
- **Engineers and tech professionals** â€“ Gaining expertise in robotics, AI, and industrial automation.  
- **Entrepreneurs and business owners** â€“ Understanding how to commercialize automation and robotics solutions.
